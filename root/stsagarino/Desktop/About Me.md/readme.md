## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Full-Stack & iOS Developer** who loves building cool stuff — from **real-time apps** that feel instant ⚡, to **iOS experiences** that just _click_ 📱.

What I usually geek out on:

- 🏗 Architectures that don’t crumble when things scale up.
- 📱 Crafting **smooth SwiftUI apps** that feel nice to use.
- ⚡ WebSockets, because real-time is just… fun.

And when I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

- 🤝 Collaborating on fun/interesting projects.
- 🎮 Gaming or streaming with friends.
- 💪 Hitting the gym.
- 🏍️ Traveling and exploring new places.
